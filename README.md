- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JWingate15. I am a recent graduate of the Cybersecurity Professional Penetration Program @ Divergence Academy in Addison, Texas. I currently have Sec + and am preparing to take my Pentest + exam. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity, penetration testing (specifically web application pentesting), threat hunting, and SOC analysis. I have a diverse educational and employment background which have refined and sharpened my analytical skills and ability to explain complex topics in simplistic terms.
