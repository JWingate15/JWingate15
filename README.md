- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JWingate15
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cybersecurity, penetration testing (specifically web application pentesting), and SOC analysis   
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently continually practicing and refining my penetration skills utilizing TryHackMe while I prepare for the CompTIA Pentest + exam
- ðŸ“« I am always looking to connect with new professionals in the cybersecurity industry, so connect with me on LinkedIn! [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-wingate/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was a professional DJ for three years after high school and now enjoy engaging in astrophotography, specifically pictures of the moon.
